        "text": "Hey Yash, thanks for sharing that with me. I've calculated your BMI, and it's 2.40.\n\nTo put that into perspective, a healthy BMI usually falls between 18.5 and 24.9. Your current BMI is quite a bit lower than that, which means you're significantly underweight.\n\nIt's really important to get to a healthy weight for your overall well-being, Yash. Being underweight can sometimes lead to its own set of health challenges. But don't you worry, we can work on this together!\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you gain weight in a healthy way:\n\n**Dietary Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods:** Instead of just eating more junk food, aim for calorie-dense foods that are also packed with nutrients. Think avocados, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, whole milk, and healthy oils like olive oil.\n*   **Eat More Frequently:** Try to have 5-6 smaller meals or snacks throughout the day rather than just 3 big ones. This can make it easier to consume more calories without feeling overly full.\n*   **Boost Your Calories with Healthy Additions:** Add extra virgin olive oil to salads, put nut butters on toast or fruit, and add cheese to dishes.\n*   **Smoothies are Your Friend:** Make smoothies with whole milk or yogurt, fruits, nut butter, and even a scoop of protein powder. They're an easy way to get in extra calories and nutrients.\n*   **Protein is Key:** Make sure you're getting enough protein to help build muscle. Include sources like chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, and legumes in your meals.\n\n**Workout Plan (Focus on Strength Training):**\n\nSince you want to gain weight in a healthy way, we'll focus on building muscle mass rather than just fat.\n\n*   **Strength Training (3-4 times a week):**\n    *   **Compound Exercises:** These work multiple muscle groups at once and are great for overall growth. Think squats, deadlifts (if you're comfortable with proper form), bench presses, overhead presses, and rows.\n    *   **Focus on Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight you lift, the number of repetitions, or the sets over time. This challenges your muscles to grow stronger.\n    *   **Proper Form Over Heavy Weight:** Always prioritize correct form to prevent injuries. It's better to lift a lighter weight with good form than a heavy weight with poor form.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Day 1: Lower Body:** Squats, Lunges, Leg Press, Calf Raises\n        *   **Day 2: Upper Body (Push):** Bench Press, Overhead Press, Triceps Extensions\n        *   **Day 3: Upper Body (Pull) & Core:** Rows, Lat Pulldowns, Bicep Curls, Planks, Crunches\n        *   **Day 4: Full Body or Rest** (depending on how you feel)\n*   **Limit Cardio (Initially):** While some light cardio is good for heart health, excessive cardio can burn too many calories, making it harder to gain weight. Stick to short, moderate sessions if you do any.\n*   **Rest and Recovery:** Your muscles grow when you're resting. Make sure you're getting enough sleep (7-9 hours) and allowing your body time to recover between workouts.\n\nRemember, Yash, consistency is key! It takes time to gain weight healthily, so be patient with yourself. And please, consider chatting with a doctor or a registered dietitian. They can give you a more personalized plan and make sure everything is on track for your specific health needs.\n\nI'm here to support you every step of the way, so let me know how you're feeling and if you have any questions!"
